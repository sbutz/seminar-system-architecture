\label{sec:epilogue}

As we look toward the future of C++ and its capabilities in parallel computing, two forthcoming features
stand out: \textbf{Senders/Receivers} and \textbf{\texttt{std::simd}}. These additions aim to enhance
asynchronous programming and data-parallel operations, respectively.

\subsection{Senders/Receivers: A New Paradigm for Asynchronous Programming}

The Senders/Receivers framework introduces a standardized approach to asynchronous operations in C++.
This model is built around three primary abstractions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Senders}: Represent asynchronous computations that will eventually produce a result.
    \item \textbf{Receivers}: Define how to handle the outcome of these computations, including successful
          results, errors, or cancellations.
    \item \textbf{Schedulers}: Manage the execution context for these operations, determining where and
          when tasks run.
\end{itemize}

This framework offers several advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Composability}: Developers can build complex asynchronous workflows by composing simpler
          operations.
    \item \textbf{Efficiency}: By providing a unified model, it reduces the overhead associated with managing
          asynchronous tasks.
    \item \textbf{Extensibility}: The modular nature allows for easy integration with various execution
          environments and libraries.
\end{itemize}

For a comprehensive overview, refer to the proposal:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{P2300R10: \texttt{std::execution}}: This document details the design and rationale behind
          the Senders/Receivers framework \cite{p2300r10}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texttt{std::simd}: Enhancing Data-Parallel Computation}

The introduction of \texttt{std::simd} brings standardized support for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple
Data) operations to C++. This feature allows developers to write data-parallel code that can be efficiently
executed across different hardware architectures.

Key aspects of \texttt{std::simd} include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Portability}: Provides a consistent interface for SIMD operations, ensuring code can run
          efficiently on various platforms.
    \item \textbf{Performance}: Enables explicit vectorization, allowing developers to harness the full
          potential of modern CPUs and accelerators.
    \item \textbf{Integration}: Seamlessly integrates with existing C++ codebases, facilitating the adoption
          of data-parallel programming practices.
\end{itemize}

For detailed information, consider the following resources:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\texttt{std::experimental::simd} Documentation}: Offers insights into the experimental
          implementation and usage of SIMD types in C++ \cite{simd_cppreference}.
    \item \textbf{P3024R0: Interface Directions for \texttt{std::simd}}: Discusses the design considerations
          and future directions for the \texttt{std::simd} interface \cite{p3024r0}.
\end{itemize}

The integration of these features into the C++ standard signifies a substantial advancement in the language's
support for parallel and asynchronous programming. As these capabilities become mainstream, developers will
be better equipped to write efficient, scalable, and maintainable code for modern computing environments.
